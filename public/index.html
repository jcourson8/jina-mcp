<h2>A Message from James</h2>

  Hello there! This project is a simple <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io" target="_blank">Model Context Protocol (MCP)</a> server designed to wrap the powerful <a href="https://jina.ai/reader/" target="_blank">Jina Reader API</a>.
  It allows Language Models (LLMs) to easily fetch, read, and process content from any URL in an LLM-friendly format.
</p>
<p>
  You can use the <code>fetch_url_content</code> tool exposed by this server to integrate web content fetching into your LLM applications.
  It supports various options for fine-grained control, similar to the Jina Reader API itself.
</p>
